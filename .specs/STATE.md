# STATE

## Decisions

### AD-001
- **Decision**: Business logic lives in a pure, framework-agnostic TypeScript core (`(state, action) -> state` reducers + selectors); React consumes it via Context/`useReducer`, and persistence sits behind a repository adapter.
- **Reason**: Maximizes unit-testability (spec-anchored tests hit pure functions) and keeps UI/logic/storage decoupled.
- **Trade-off**: More boilerplate than a store library; manual Context wiring.
- **Scope**: All features in this project (state/domain layering).

### AD-002
- **Decision**: The product is a front-end-only prototype over bundled mock data — no backend, no real email transport (IMAP/SMTP/Gmail), no authentication.
- **Reason**: Scope decision for the HEY-style reader; focuses effort on design/UX and triage behavior.
- **Trade-off**: No real mail; "send/reply" affordances mutate local state only. Real transport is a future fullstack feature that would supersede this.
- **Scope**: Whole project until explicitly superseded.

### AD-003
- **Decision**: Client state persists to `localStorage` guarded by a `schemaVersion`, with fallback and reset to the bundled seed.
- **Reason**: Lets triage decisions survive reloads without a backend while staying demo-resettable and resilient to schema drift.
- **Trade-off**: Single-browser, single-user only; no cross-device sync.
- **Scope**: Persistence layer for all features.

### AD-004
- **Decision**: Test stack is Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom.
- **Reason**: Vite-native and fast; RTL covers view behavior, Vitest covers the pure core.
- **Trade-off**: Commits to the Vitest ecosystem over Jest.
- **Scope**: All automated tests in the project.

## Handoff

- **Feature**: hey-mail-reader (`.specs/features/hey-mail-reader/`)
- **Phase / Task**: Execute / T1 - scaffold the project
- **Completed**: Specify, Design, Tasks approved; structural gates passed
- **In-progress** (file:line): none
- **Next step**: Execute approved sequential batches T1-T9, T10-T12, T13-T20 with per-task local commits, then independent verification.
- **Blockers**: none
- **Uncommitted files**: planning artifacts pending baseline commit; pre-existing `.github/skills/` installation remains outside implementation commits
- **Branch**: master (local repository initialized with user approval)
